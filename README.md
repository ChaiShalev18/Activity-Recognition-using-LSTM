# Activity-Recognition-using-LSTM-with-Minimal-Sensor-Inputs
Develop LSTM-based time series classification model to accurately recognize user activities using minimal sensor inputs. Data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation for high accuracy.
## About:
The goal of this project is to develop a time series classification model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to accurately classify activities conducted by users with minimal sensor inputs. The project will involve collecting time series data from a limited number of sensors, such as accelerometers or gyroscopes, capturing user activities. The data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the data, and extract relevant features. An LSTM-based deep learning model will be built using TensorFlow or PyTorch, taking the preprocessed time series data as input, and outputting the predicted activity label. The model will be trained using the training set, and hyperparameters will be tuned for optimal performance. The performance of the trained LSTM model will be evaluated using the testing set, and the project aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying activities with minimal sensor inputs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for activity recognition tasks.
