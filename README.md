# Activity Recognition using LSTM with Minimal Sensor Inputs
This project, a collaborative effort by @livneido1, @eladinbar, and @ChaiShalev18, aims to develop an LSTM-based time series classification model for accurately recognizing user activities using minimal sensor inputs. The goal is to build a model that can effectively classify different activities based on time series data collected from a limited number of sensors, such as accelerometers or gyroscopes.

## Project Details
The assignment involves: data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, LSTM model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation for accurate classification of user activities using time series data from sensors.

## Features

- Utilizes Python programming language for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- Supports  PyTorch deep learning frameworks for building and training the LSTM-based model.
- Handles missing values, normalizes data, and performs necessary transformations for data quality in preprocessing.
- Extracts relevant features from time series data using statistical measures or domain-specific techniques in feature engineering.
- Facilitates model training and evaluation using the chosen deep learning framework.
- Enables hyperparameter tuning to optimize the LSTM model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Utilizes PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and other Python libraries for deep learning and data manipulation tasks.
- Data preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw text data into suitable formats for model training.
- Deep learning: Builds and trains neural networks using PyTorch for relevance prediction.
- Model evaluation: Utilizes appropriate evaluation metrics  for performance assessment.
